in bash (for Windows), run this command:
$ npm link // in root 'testme' folder
then, in the project you want to run test files, run this command:
$ testme

TESTME tests nodejs files and has JSDOM for testing DOM elements, which is why there are sample.project (testing node code) and sample.web.project (testing DOM elements)
